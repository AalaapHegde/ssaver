    <h1 class="w3-margin w3-xlarge">Inspiration</h1>
    <p class="w3-medium">Food insecurity is one of societyâ€™s fastest-growing concerns. Did you know that in 2019,
        about 10 million
        children alone suffered from food insecurity, and this alarming number is projected to increase at rapid
        rates?
        Despite producing enough food to sustainably feed everyone, the USA creates over 200 billion pounds of food
        waste each year. As high school students, we felt the need to take this issue into our own hands and create
        ScrapSaver, an effective communications platform for the relay of produce and cooked meals between
        restaurants
        and hotels to food banks and grocery drives.</p>
